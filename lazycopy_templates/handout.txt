Templetize lazy copy assignment.

Implement 1-1 friendship for stream insertion operator (20% of the grade)
    class Proxy {
        public:
            friend std::ostream& operator<< ( std::ostream &out, Proxy<DataType> const& proxy );

        private:

    };

ALL IMPLEMENTATION in array.cpp (30% of the grade).

I'll have TA to go over submissions and take points off for the above 2 requiremenets.
